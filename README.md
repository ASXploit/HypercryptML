# HypercryptML
HML is an automatic Html Obfuscation script and still a work in progress.

# What does it do?
HypercryptML or HML Script reads a specified pages Html code and Obfuscates it by converting the code into a string then converting the string into Hexadecimal.. After it is converted it is placed in between Script tags in Javascript allowing javascript to handle the code.

# How is HML Better than any other Html Encryptor?
HML is not an Html Encryptor.. It is an Obfuscation script.. Why is it better? Other tools require you to keep a non obfuscated version of your Html so you can update it and go back to there page for a re-obfuscation.. Which seems like a great hassle for something so simple..

Unlike other Html Obfuscation tools.. HML Makes NO Hard Edits to your html file.. Meaning? the obfuscation is sort of Temporary.. it only appears to be obfuscated to the user.. It also means when you update your Html file you wont need to make any changes to the php script nor will you need to go somewhere for a re-obfuscation ! Less of a hassle , easy to use  , all around Easy !

# What is the downside of using HML?
The only downside i can think of ... Is the fact you have no control over what part of the code gets obfuscated.. Which i should add i would not have any internal Javascript,PHP,CSS inside of your Html file , please keep them External to avoid any bugs.
